# Elevate-Labs-Assignment-1

## The concepts that I have used to build the calculator are:

- *Methods* such as add(), subtract(), multiply(), divide().
- *Scanner class* – to get input from the user that performs the operations.
- *Loops* – I have used while loop to repeat the operations.
- *Switch case* – I have used switch case to perform the actions which the user provides.
- *Condition* – Used if-else to check the conditions that the user provides.
